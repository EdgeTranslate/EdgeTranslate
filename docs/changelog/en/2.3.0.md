### Sponsor

It took us much time and energy to develop this project. If it truly helped you in some way, you could reward us with cans of Coke to support us to keep improving it: [PayPal](https://paypal.me/EdgeTranslate).

But, this is completely **voluntary**. Sponsoring won't bring any special treatment and you can still use Edge Translate freely without sponsoring. Do it according to your capability!
