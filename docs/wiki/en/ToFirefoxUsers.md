## Hello Firefox users

I am one of the developers of Edge Translate. I am mainly responsible for the management of Edge Translate on the Firefox browser.

First of all, thank you for your love of Edge Translate. Thanks to your support, Edge Translate can reach today. Thank you very much!

But I'm sorry to inform you that we have to delete web translation related functions in Edge Translate on Firefox browser (the versions on other platforms are not affected). We feel pity about this, but we have no choice.

In simple terms, in order to implement the web page translation function, we need to use Youdao and Google's web page translation components, but these components are private and we cannot obtain their source code. Now, Firefox requires us to provide the source code for all third-party components we use, otherwise our extensions will be removed from the store. The reviewers suggested that we may look for open source implementations, but we couldn't find any, so we have to delete this feature to pass the review.

This extension is a work we have developed in our free time, which has accumulated a lot of our hard work. Being forced to delete this hard-implemented function making us very sad, plus many problems of Firefox itself (such as not supporting the use of extension built-in pdf reader, which caused the pdf wording function of Edge Translate to be invalid; not supporting adding buttons to notifications, which caused us to spend extra time for compatibility, etc.) bringing additional development costs to us, we may not add new features to Edge Translate on Firefox. We strongly recommend that users who like Edge Translate try to use Chromium-based browsers, such as Chrome, the new version of Edge, or the open source Chromium.

If you really need web translation function, you may manually download and install the last version that support it at [here](https://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/releases/download/1.7.2/EdgeTranslate_firefox_v1.7.2.xpi).

In addition, there are some good extensions on Firefox that have not been removed due to problems with third-party components, such as [Saladict](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/addon/ext-saladict ), You can download and have a try.

Thank you for your continued support!
